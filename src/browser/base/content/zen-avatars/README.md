# Zen's Avatars

All avatars are fetched from [boring avatars](https://boringavatars.com/). Thanks a lot! <3

# Downloading avatars

Go directly to the `content/zen-avatars` folder (where this README is located) and execute the following script:

```
python3 fetch-all-avatars.py
```

# Notes

100 (0-99) avatars will be created and that's what the browser will handle. If you want to add more avatars, you can modify the `fetch-all-avatars.py` script and the browser's code to handle more avatars.
