## üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility

Zen is currently built using firefox version `134.0.2`! üöÄ

- [`Zen Twilight`](https://zen-browser.app/download?twilight) - Is currently built using firefox version `RC 134.0.2`!
- Check out the latest [release notes](https://zen-browser.app/release-notes)!
- Part of our mission is to keep Zen up-to-date with the latest version of Firefox, so you can enjoy the latest features and security updates!

## ü§ù Contribution

Zen is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines](./docs/contribute.md) before getting started!

### Issue metrics

We keep track of how many issues are closed at the end of the month in [docs/issue-metrics](./docs/issue-metrics). This is to keep track of how many issues are being closed, because who doesn't like to see progress? üìà

### Versioning

Zen uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning. Meaning, versions are displayed as `a.bc.d` where:

- `a` is the major version
- `b` is the minor version
- `c` is the branch prefix
- `d` is the patch version

### Branches

Zen is divided into 2 main branches. We use `dev` for development and `stable` for stable releases. The `dev` branch is where all the new features are added and where `twilight` builds are generated. The `stable` branch is where the stable releases are generated.

We divide into 2 branches in case there's any really important security update (for example) that needs to be released before the next stable release. This allows us to do patches without releasing unstable versions to the public.

## ‚ö° Performance

Zen is built with performance in mind, and we have optimized the browser to be as fast as possible! Checkout the latest [performance benchmarks](https://docs.zen-browser.app/benchmarks)!
